Every Christmas comes with people hoping to surprise the ones they love with a gift they will love.  I remember when I was in Middle School and found the place where my mother had hidden our presents without having wrapped them yet.  I was getting an electronic football game!  I was excited to see it and to play it in reality.I love to play games of all kinds because I love the surprises they bring.  It’s fun to not know what strategy your opponent will use, what roll of the dice may be next, or what letters you might pull out of the Scrabble bag. And being surprised is often a very good thing in our world that too often is predictable.

In light of that, we will explore during the Christmas season how the experiences of the characters in the Christmas story live out popular games in their own surprising ways.
On December 1 we will hear the call of John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus by saying Here He Comes Ready or Not!  On December 8 we will watch how Joseph reacts the news of his future as he chooses whether to 2 Truths or a Lie. On December 15, we will look at Mary and Elizabeth rejoicing together as they realize the victory they have in God like in Tic, Tac, Tac, Toe.  One December 22, we will consider the call of Mary where she is spoken to by the God of Rock, Paper and Scissors.  On December 24, Christmas Eve, we’ll look at how the events that happened that night give a winning Bingo! for all who know Jesus. (see last page)
On Christmas Eve over 2000 years ago, God came as a baby.  It was a surprise to humanity but was just the full revelation of how God works.  God loves people.  God walked with people.  God died for people.  And we get to live in the confidence of those truths today.
This Thanksgiving and Christmas, may you and your family find surprises in moments that bring you real joy and opportunities to love those you are with.
