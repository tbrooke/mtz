At MTZ UCC, we believe in using our hands in ministry. Our outreach efforts give us the chance to be difference makers with our hands in a variety of ways.  Here are some ways in which we use our hands that members can plug into and make a difference for God. 

**Hand Out Ministry:**  We are beginning a partnership with South Side Church of God, China Grove, to hand out food to needy families on Tuesdays.  They work 4 days a week to collect food from Food Lion and other sources.  There are items, however, they rarely get that we, at MTZ, will start collecting monthly to help their vibrant ministry.

Each month we will seek 250 items that we will take near the end of the month for one week of distribution.  Here is our summer collection/donation schedule for this vital hand out ministry:

**June** – Jars of Peanut Butter

**July** – Bags of Rice

**August** – Bottles of Cooking Oil

**Hand Up Ministry:**  We continue our partnership in support of Main Street Marketplace.  Through the generous donations to the church budget, we are able to give annually to this vital ministry that helps people to self-support and stability.

**Hands On Ministry:** Our MTZ Youth are washing cars on Saturday, June 8 from 1-4 p.m. in the MTZ parking lot. They are raising money for their summer mission trip to Virginia Beach. They are going July 23-26 to meet with youth from across the Southern Conference for worship, service, and celebration.

Are your hands itching to keep on meeting needs for God in our community and beyond?  These are three ways in which we are difference makers.  I can’t wait to see the ways in which MTZ people support these ministries.  And I look forward to new ways in which God will lead our church to take a stand for God through mission.

In Christ’s Service, Pastor Jim Simonds, Mt. Zion UCC
