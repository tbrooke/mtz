I like to win. I like to win playing Pickleball. At home, Cheryl and I play
Scrabble, Backgammon, Rummy, Tri-ominos, Yahtzee, Ticket to Ride and
more. We both like to win those games and usually know who is more likely
to win which ones as we are better or worse individually at certain games.
When we add our daughter, our son’s family and/or my wife, we break out
Word Games, Uno, Rummikub, Dominos, Clue, Careers, Take Off or Trekking. And it’s often
uncertain who will win.
The New Testament talks about victory in a few places. The victory has been won for US
by CHRIST

• Romans 8:37 Overwhelming victory is ours through Christ who loved us!

• Corinthians 15:4 “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

• Corinthians 15:8 Since future victory is sure, be strong and steady.

• Ephesians 4:8 Christ returned triumphantly to heaven after his resurrection and
victory over Satan.

We live, my brothers and sisters in the MTZ family, with the victory already won for us by Jesus Christ. Christ finished His race first perfectly, now we simply run our races with the victory assured by His power and grace. Now, if you see me out on a pickleball court or at a table when we have a game night, you might still see me seeking to finish first over whatever other players are on the court or at the table. But when it comes to Who God loves and Who is a child of God, I don’t need to win over another person, instead I simply rejoice that God loves us both. We can both finish “first” since Christ has won the victory for me and them. This is what the Scriptures promise and to them I say, AMEN. Let it be so my Savior and Friend.

In Christ’s Service, Pastor Jim Simonds, Mt. Zion UCC
