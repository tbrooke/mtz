Greetings to the congregation from the halls of preschool! Most classes are full, but we still could add a few 4s. We have 90 happy and smiling children and a full parking lot. Our staff of fourteen are dedicated, creative, caring ladies with whom itis a pleasure to work with!

This year, we are excited to have many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of our Mt Zion members. It is such a joy to see these Mt Zion family members here as part of our preschool! If you have a family member interested, please have them contact us!

We are so thankful to the technology team of Tom Brooke, Jason Harwood, and Jeff Schroyer for all that they have done to enhance our internet capabilities. We appreciate all the time they have devoted to us! THANKS SO MUCH!

Our Fall Festivals are to be held on October 22nd and 24th. We would love to have a few Mt Zion volunteers here to help us. Let me know if you can spend either day with our children. Our Wanda Corriher was always here for this day and we still miss her so much!

Our sale of Texas Roadhouse gift certificates will be going on from Oct. 1st to 27th. Please consider buying these for gifts or just to use. We will accept cash or check. Watch for more info to come. Start asking and taking orders if you wish! Our preschool received $1000 last year from this fundraiser! 

We have invited our families to come to Trunk or Treat on the 26th, either to host a trunk or stop by them. We hope lots of Mt Zion families will come out with trunks open and decorated! 

It will be a great night of fellowship! Thanks for all of your
